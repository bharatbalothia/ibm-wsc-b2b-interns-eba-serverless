      absg archive process was suppose to be redesigned after if crashed years
      ago due to the increase of volume but it was never prioritized. Originally
      with the smaller volume we had a daily zip file that was just added to.  
      The quickest solution at the time of the crash was to change the
      parameters to just zip each file until we could come up with a better

      RE: EDI VISION: ICS IB 940 - Go Live / Cutover\n\nHi Manish/Scott,\n\nWe
      have discussed with IBM with a case for this issue. IBM suggested there
      should need a map settings to update.\n\nWTX map fix:\nCurrently
      :                            WorkFilePrifix = MapName\nIBM Suggested
      settings : WorkFilePrifix = Unique\n\nThis is discussed in the call as it
      is not related to disk space error from the UNIX server side. We have good
      amount of space /opt/app file mount. So we are not requesting to UNIX team
      to raise as of
      now.\n\nNode5:\n/dev/mapper/EDIbinVG-appLV

      VISION: ICS IB 940 - Go Live / Cutover\n\nEveryone �\nHere is a quick
      recap on the overnight cutover and a summary of some follow-up items for
      the teams:\n\n1. We experienced a temporary issue with three files failed
      due to a disk error when using temporary space for processing.  This is
      the first time the team is seeing this but we reprocessed and cleared up
      space to resolve the issue.\na. ACTION: Tech Admin team will complete an
      RCA on the error to confirm it was space related.\nb. ACTION: Tech Admin
      will request more space to be allocated so in future our working directory
      has more space available.\n2. The temporary issue also caused five files
      to process correctly but not capture the visibility (aka \"metadata\")
      information properly.\na. ACTION: We will work with Shane to see if we
      want to reprocess to capture the data for reporting but then prevent
      duplicate processing or not reprocess and provide data manually.\n\nWe
      have seen new orders coming in without issue and confirmed the mentioned
      files are reprocessed without issue.\n\nThank you, Scott\n\n-----Original

      @Veeramachaneni, Naveen � if you can share the error details, I would
      appreciate it (I probably butchered the description)\nThe exchange point
      was restarted again, but did not work\nWe moved the remaining 62 files to
      a temporary location (pickup is set to read from both locations) and they
      got picked up\n12 of those files were initially in In Process status, but
      had made it to the Axway box, so they were successfully sent on the next
      Retry.\n\n\nAs of now, all files will go to the normal pickup location and
